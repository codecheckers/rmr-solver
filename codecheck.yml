summary: >
  Codecheck performed interactively as part of the Delft 2023 workshop.
  The codecheck was undertaken with the first author observing and able to help fix issues.
  This meant that the codecheck was fairly quick and any issues were resolved fairly quickly.
  With some fixes, the code was confirmed to work and Figure 3 could be reproduced with some visual differences due to post-processing of the figures before publication, as was confirmed by the author.
